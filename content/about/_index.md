<img src="/img/hugh.jpg" class="headshot"> Hugh Paterson III first came to Eugene in 2005. Fell in love with the city and promised to return. At the time he wrote in his journal that he needed to buy a house in Eugene. Three years later he married Rebecca Paterson nee Smith. In 2012 they moved to Eugene where Rebecca started her Ph.D. in Linguistics. They lived in the Fairmont Neighborhood for several years. In 2015 they bought a house in Amazon Neighborhood (and their first child Katja was born). Hugh loves to bike the south hills and drink tea.

Hugh has served as administrative staff for an international non-governmental organization (NGO) for the last 10 years and prior to that he worked for companies such as Apple, Inc. and Starbucks. He looks forward to providing leadership in a Eugene that his 2-year old daughter can enjoy for many years to come.
