Hugh Paterson III first came to Eugene in 2005. Fell in love with the city and promised to return. At the time he wrote in his journal that he needed to buy a house in Eugene. Three years later he married Rebecca Paterson nee Smith. In 2012 they moved to Eugene where Rebecca started her Ph.D. in Linguistics. They lived in the Fairmont Neighborhood for several years. In 2015 they bought a house in Amazon Neighborhood (and their first child Katja was born). Hugh loves to bike the south hills and drink tea.
