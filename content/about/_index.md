<p>  The measure for independent Auditor sets the tone for this election. The People of Eugene expect <em>Clarity</em>, <em>Openness</em>, and a <em>demonstration of responsibility</em> from their <b>elected officials</b> and their <b>appointed officials</b>.</p>

  <p>The essence of Eugene that we hold dear, be it our Eugene neighborhoods or the larger character of our city is being challenged by internal and external pressures.</p>

  <p>The pace and scope of change in Eugene is set to increase. <em>Do we have the policies in place to protect the essence and character of the eugene that we treasure as we move forward?</em></p>

  I’m running for city council because we shouldn’t embrace the future blindly. I’m offering the voters a choice. A choice between the current status quo and someone who can listen to what we treasure and take it to the policy directing level of our community.

  We are a city that pushed Walmart out to the fringes of our community in favor of locally owned businesses, but at the same time we created an environment where we have turned over a much bigger economic driver than Walmart to non-local businesses – The Eugene Rental market. The rental market and our housing situation has been our own doing for these last 20 years. No silver bullet is going to solve all the different types of housing challenges we face. But we don’t need short term tax relief strategies to be the guiding principals shaping our long term future.

  The biggest contributor to the housing demand in Ward 3 is the University. Unconstrained growth by the university means that our city infrastructure, including our available housing, will continue to be stretched beyond its planned capacity. We need better long term planning for the integrated growth of our community and the university.

  Every businessman in Eugene appreciates the business that the university brings to our economy. But It is the policy making bodies that determine when and how that business will impact the character of our community. Do we want to continue in a situation where we hold the favorite programs of Eugene Citizens hostage for increased taxes via city bond programs while we give tax breaks to outside investors?

<p>The architecture of our community is reflective of our management priorities and the policies that guide that management. We can all think of the good, the bad, and the ugly architecture in Eugene. I’ll let you decide where City Hall fits.</p>
