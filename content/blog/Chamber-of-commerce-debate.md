+++

The Eugene City Chamber of Commerce invited all three Ward 3 candidates to answer four questions and some questions from its members. (My answers can be found on my Q & A page.)

* What do you see as your role as an elected official? How do you or would you make decisions on council?
* Increasing affordability, availability and diversity of housing is a high priority of the Chamber.  What do you see as the biggest challenges to addressing this and can you provide a few ideas on actions that you, as a City Councilor, can take to improve housing in Eugene?
* Elaborate on your vision for downtown. What is your plan to remove the current barriers to downtown revitalization?
* What is something the Chamber is not doing that you think we should be?

The chamber has already come out against an Independent Elected Auditor. I am genuinely interested to know _why_, other than a blanket statement of support for the incumbent.
