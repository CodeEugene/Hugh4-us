## Where does Hugh stand on the Capitol Hill PUD?

### City council involvement
As it stands right now the city council does not have an avenue, or reason to be involved in the PUD process - on the Capitol Hill PUD or any other PUD. PUD approval is an administrative process. A very relevant question could be: _Has the city administration done due diligence to preserve city scene scape_?

Working to create policy and better direct city staff on how to preserve city scene scape is something that city council can do. Directing city staff to review R-1 Zoning within the Urban Growth Boundary on the bases of geological survey data is something that city council could do. But these actions shouldn't just apply to the Capitol Hill PUD.

### Personal loss

> One of the reasons I bought my house was the great view out my kitchen window. I am loath to lose this forested view. Forested views are one of the components that contribute to the Eugene city character. In general I see that Eugene has a plan for parks but I don't see how Eugene has committed to preserve natural scene scape. In general I don't think any of the parties involved are asking the best questions for our community's future - we should be asking about zoning, and we should be computing with maximum population figures based on SB 1051.

### More needed housing

Eugene certainly needs more housing solutions. However, the _needed housing_ argument has been used to support the claim and passage the Capitol Hill PUD. Given the following issues it is difficult to see how this is a legitimate use of this claim:

* Soil type on Capitol Hill - Geological limitations on development above certain elevations in Eugene.
* Copious undeveloped lots in Laural Hill on other PUD projects.
* Quantity and cost of the civic infrastructure for the PUD.

Eugene may be required to allow additional development any where which is possible by state law. So one question to continue to ask in the Capitol Hill PUD case is: _is the zoning of Capitol Hill as R-1 appropriate, and if not what is then appropriate? - Especially if one can not develop over a certain elevation in Eugene due to Geological considerations._

### Neutral testimony provided at PUD hearing

Hugh did give neutral testimony at the PUD hearing. His point there at the haring was this:

>Oregon Senate Bill 1051 requires that every single family dwelling be allowed to build an ADU. This means that all of the surveys and traffic studies done based on the projected population density on the Capitol Hill PUD are errant. Because to compute the maximum possible density on the Capitol Hill PUD we essentially have to double the population density.

On March 12 Hugh wrote the following to Nicholas R. Gioello, M. Adm. Associate Planner in the City of Eugene Planning Division:

>I hope it is not too late to add something to to official record for the testimony on the capital hill PUD hearing. <br/><br/>I gave oral testimony about the relevance of OR SB 1051.<br/><br/>In essence I said that I do not see that the current plan actually took into account the additional and state mandated changes to the Eugene City Code.<br/><br/>In thoughtful reflection I thought it might be clearer if I mailed my concerns.<br/><br/>SB 1051 requires significant adjustment to the Eugene City land use code, and must be implemented by July 1 2018. For a very thorough brief of what sections of Eugene City Code need to be updated I refer you to Bill Kloos's memo to the Eugene planning commission for the march 6th meeting  (pg. 21-39). https://www.eugene-or.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_03062018-869 (PDF)<br/><br/>Section 6 of SB 1051 requires that every place where a house can be built on R1, must allow for a second UN-attached ADU. This means that every parcel on Capital hill can essentially have a duplex on it, and some lots can have more... that may not be the kind of buildings that the PUD planers anticipate buyers are going to build, but it is important as we consider what the true population density of the area under consideration is and then the applicability of the commissioned safety analysis, and utility requirements.<br/><br/>What I am saying is that Eugene city code can not legally stop ADUs from being build on these lots, as Zoned R-1, and therefore the possible housing density - even with a reduced lot count from what is allowable under R-1 is not accurately reported in the PUD proposal, nor is it reflected in the safety and traffic analysis, nor water consumption/waste water estimations.<br/><br/>It is my hope that the city perform due diligence in actually considering the proposal under the required changes pursuant to SB 1051.<br/><br/>I want a better Eugene for today and tomorrow. I would hate for our children to bear a tax burden for in adequate/inappropriate planning now.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
all the best,<br/><br/>
Thank you for your service to our community

### City's conflict of interest

It seems that the city's interests are severed whenever development is conducted because they increase the value of the property and their own revenue stream. This is an immense pressure to approve PUDs from just an income based perspective.

Policy tells us how we can strike a better balance between various interests and strike a balance which is appropriate for a better Eugene today and tomorrow.
