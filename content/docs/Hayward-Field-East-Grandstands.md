## Where does Hugh stand on Preservation of the Hayward Field East Grandstands?

### City council involvement
This is not directly a policy issue. However, there are several interesting issues around the replacement and/or preservation of the Hayward Field East Grandstands.

### The grand stands are an iconic feature of Eugene
The grandstands to take us to a place where history was made. Both for the then future of Nike, and the University of Oregon. Eugene as a city has embraced this historical narrative. Hugh certainly has. _How should Eugene make room for new iconic features, and newly developing narratives?_ If we exclusively embrace new architecture and construction around the grandstands, then they will eventually look out of place. The grandstands come from an era when craftsman houses were popular - and they are both still popular today. From an visual perspective these styles help give Eugene the vibe it has today.

### Do the grandstands even belong to Eugene City?
As far as legal ownership it seems that the grandstands are squarely in the ownership of the University of Oregon. What power, or right does the city have to tell a property owner that what they can or can't do with their property? From a policy perspective, this is the same issue that is before the community in regards to the Capitol Hill PUD.

### Ongoing relationship between Ward 3 neighbors and the University

Many components of the University's growth plans are not well coordinated with the neighborhoods around it. Increases to enrollment impact our neighborhoods, and the quality of life there.

### New grandstands don't solve Fairmont parking issues

With additional destination features being brought to the University and its surrounding areas we need a better solution to parking. Current parking solutions do not take cars off the streets.
Hugh is in favor of a  private-public partnership to build a parking garage in Fairmont, one that stylistically matches the neighborhood and provides capacity to pull cars off the streets. Give students free passes during the week for parking in the parking garage, and charge for event parking. Prevent all street parking except for residents (and their guests).
