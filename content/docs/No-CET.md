## Should Eugene implement a Construction Exercise Tax (CET )?
In response to  _Jacob Fox and Terry McDonald_ who published a guest opinion in the [Register Guard on April 6th 2018](http://registerguard.com/rg/opinion/36620851-78/construction-excise-tax-could-help-build-affordable-housing.html.csp).
**It does not make sense to implement a CET in Eugene.**

When we look at how the math pencils out, it would be much better for Eugene Citizens to donate to 501( c)3 organizations like St. Vincent de Paul who are making a real difference in Lane County. By implementing a CET, Eugene would be permanently increasing the cost of unsubsidized land and housing. By increasing the price of land we are further separating the economic classes which already disproportionately dis-advantages those who on the lower end of the economic spectrum. These actions will solidify the need for “subsidized housing” in Eugene. Forcing people to give to solve a social issue doesn’t actually solve the issue - it solidifies the problem. I ask these directors if they had $58,000 a week to solve the homeless problem in Eugene, _would that really solve the problem?_

CET is paid when building or remolding a home. It is assessed during the permit process - a process some are already claiming is to expensive. The indirect result (higher general housing prices) will greatly out weigh the direct results (small enclaves of subsidized housing). It may take a few months for housing prices to increase, but home owners will be adding the CET amount to the new sell price at the time of home's next re-sale. With higher house prices, how can we ever reach affordable housing for everyone? How does the “long tail” of the impact of the CET help St. Vincent de Paul achieve its goal to
>help all individuals find a path out of poverty and into self-sufficiency?

The CET fails at this point. It makes the transition from assisted housing to self-sufficiency a larger leap.

Perhaps those who want the CET, also want to protect the “value” of their properties and push the homeless crises out of their neighborhoods. It is quite easy to see how raising the price of a neighborhood would put any hope of integrating into well established Eugene neighborhoods out of reach for individuals or families transitioning into self-sufficiency. I ask the fantastic Mr. Fox and Terry McDonald, _does this prejudice foster a social attitude which is conducive to solving the social injustice goals their organizations report to combat?_  

501( c)3 organizations committed to creating social change, must have multiple bottom line methods of assessing the actions and programs their organizations participate undertake. This is not too different from the reasons Eugene City also has a multiple bottom line method for evaluating its endeavors. It is fantastic that St. Vincent de Paul is a leader in Lane County in meeting the needs of the poor - especially the homeless. However, if solutions for meeting physical needs also do not solve the sociological divides in our community then the proposed solutions need to be abandoned or reworked. Giving the payee of the CET the ability to assuage their conscience that they did something good for their fellow citizen without ever engaging directly with the individual (or the humanitarian organization) actually serves to disassociate the parties from each other.

The CET does not make economic sense (rising housing costs), it does not make sociological sense (brining our community together as a solution to social injustice issues), it does not make financial sense (just give a tax deductible donation). It does make sense that an aggressive city government would be interested in implementing the CET. Only 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing… that is in some implementation models the city gets to keep 50% of the tax to use on other things!

According to transcripts of the both the Eugene Planning Committee and the City Council not all of the revenue generated from a CET is required to be spend on housing subsidies. Therefore Mr. Fox and Mr. McDonald are likely to see a lot less than the numbers their opinion piece cites.

> "... are some flexibilities within the legislation so for a residential CET 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing incentives if local jurisdiction also adopts an inclusionary ..."

The CET has been discussed for some time in the city government. See Eugene city materials here: https://www.eugene-or.gov/3712/Task-Team-1
