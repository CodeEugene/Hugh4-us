## We can increase Accountability through an independent elected auditor

Read the ballot measure 20-283. It is professional. This is the professional solution. Eugene is mature enough to benefit from an elected auditor.

## We can increase Accountability by making Eugene's transactional data open

By putting Eugene's transactional data in the open it gives citizens the capability of engage in areas of interest to them and have the same data that the city is looking at. It supports the narrative of city staff. It give the city council access to the larger story.

## Freedom from additional bond measures

Bond measure might be needed in the future, but why? and for what? We need clear presentation of the way that our finances are handled. When we are asked to pass over $30 million in bond based 'taxes' should we ask why? Why are the Park funds on the bond measure instead of PERS? If the Parks and Rec division of city government was audited by an independent auditor would we still need $30 million?

## Required use of bond monies on the agreed upon allocated projects.

Hugh is glad the city has taken the necessary steps to create a quite zone downtown near the railroad. _But should have the city council approved the use of river front renewal bond money to do this?_ **No.** That is $2 Million dollars out of the proposed river front renewal project which was already "sold" to citizens. It was a legal option that the city council chose to exercise. However, they did it at the cost of "renegotiating their public contract" for the river front urban renewal project. **Let's use funds where they were allocated for.**
