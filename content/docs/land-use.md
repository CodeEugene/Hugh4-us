## We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene.

#### There is no one size fits all solution. There is no silver bullet.

We have various kinds of housing crisis in Eugene. We have chronically homeless. We have temporary homeless. We have a shortage of affordable housing for people on fixed incomes who want to own their own property. We have a shortage of housing for (lower income) students. We have a shortage of small properties for single member households. We have some who say that there is a lack of extravagant homes in the upper income range â€” but numerically the greater impact of the housing need is felt in the lower income ranges.

# Solutions need to include

* Adding a Construction Exercise tax does not need to be part of the solution.
* Lowering city permit fees and _System Development Charges_ should be part of our solution.
* In some places in the city we need to increase population density.
  * We should move the city away from an Euclidean based code and towards a Form-based code. <a href="http://www.andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20140515.php">See examples</a>.
* We need to protect the look, feel, and vibe of our city.
  * We sould seek to improve the <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/">walk-ability scores</a> of neighborhoods and encourage productive mix use  facilities.
* Providing legal low or no cost pathways to more efficient use of the structures already in use in our city should be a policy making priority.
* <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/SB1051">SB 1051 is an Oregon State Law</a>. City Counsel runs the likelihood of increasing the city's costs via legal fees due to their slow response to bring Eugene city code into compliance.
  * The most sensible response to SB 1051 for Eugene city code that Hugh has seen, is Bill Kloos' brief to the city which is <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_03062018-869">Attachment C in the linked Eugene city document</a>.
* Some parts of our city restrict the density level below state recommenced levels. This unnecessarily inflates the price of housing.
