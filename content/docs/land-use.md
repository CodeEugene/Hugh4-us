## We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene. There is no silver bullet.

* Adding a Construction Exercise tax does not need to be part of the solution.
* Lowering city permit fees and _System Development Charges_ should be part of our solution.
* In some places in the city we need to increase population density.
* We need to protect the look, feel, and vibe of our city.
* Providing pathways to more efficient using the structures already in use in our city should be a policy making priority.
