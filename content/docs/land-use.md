## We need lots of housing solutions in Eugene.

#### There is no one size fits all solution. There is no silver bullet.

We have various kinds of housing crisis in Eugene. We have chronically homeless. We have temporary homeless. We have a shortage of affordable housing for people on fixed incomes who want to own their own property. We have a shortage of housing for (lower income) students. We have a shortage of small properties for single member households. We have some who say that there is a lack of extravagant homes in the upper income range â€” but numerically the greater impact of the housing need is felt in the lower income ranges.

# Solutions need to include

* Adding a Construction Exercise tax does not need to be part of the solution.
* Lowering city permit fees and _System Development Charges_ should be part of our solution.
* In some places in the city we need to increase population density.
  * We should move the city away from an Euclidean based code and towards a Form-based code. <a href="http://www.andrewalexanderprice.com/blog20140515.php">See examples</a>.
* We need to protect the look, feel, and vibe of our city.
  * We should seek to improve the <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/">walk-ability scores</a> of neighborhoods and encourage productive mix use  facilities.
* Providing legal low or no cost pathways to more efficient use of the structures already in use in our city should be a policy making priority.
* <a href="https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2017R1/Measures/Overview/SB1051">SB 1051 is an Oregon State Law</a>. City Counsel runs the likelihood of increasing the city's costs via legal fees due to their slow response to bring Eugene city code into compliance.
  * The most sensible response to SB 1051 for Eugene city code that Hugh has seen, is Bill Kloos' brief to the city which is <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_03062018-869">Attachment C in the linked Eugene city document</a>.
* Some parts of our city restrict the density level below state recommenced levels. This unnecessarily inflates the price of housing.

## What does livability mean?

This is a great question: and is only matched in greatness by asking _What is affordable housing?_

Livability to Hugh means we have the infrastructure in place to create healthy and vibrant communities.

Alan Zelenka says that in his tenure as City Councilor livability has meant: _controlling noise, providing parking, and solving traffic flow issues_. These are important issues, but these three issues do not define all of _livability_.

We should expand our understanding of livability to include looking at issues like mixed use areas where entrepreneurial services can thrive. We should look at walkscore and the walkability of our neighborhoods. We should look at the workability of our neighborhoods. Livability means that we can live in a way that is sustainable, be that using solar power to recover utility costs, or renting an Auxiliary Dwelling Unit to offset the rising taxes on our properties.

We have a growing population of retiring baby-boomers who want to own their own house, but don't want a large house - or even a two bedroom home. How livable is our neighborhoods for them?
