## No Paper / Plastic signs

Recently Hugh went to the _The Glenwood Central Receiving Station_ he says"

>I noticed all these political signs in the trash. It really challenged me to think about the environmental impacts of my campaign. I can run a facebook add just as much as printing signs and flyers. It has less of an impact to the environment.

If you want a city councilor who is concerned with the environment and our social responsibility, look no further than Hugh Paterson III. You can expect to see business card size invitations to have a face to face with Hugh and to talk about your passions for a better Eugene.

## How will you help leading Eugene toward 100% Clean Energy by 2050?
We need to work on community development strategies (especially at the city policy level) that make passive home construction practical and affordable. This needs to be part of our affordable housing plan. We also need create an economy where renewable energy solutions are the affordable solution. Right now there is a significant financial barrier, and a slow return on investment for those who pay upfront for renewable Energy. As long as the cost of renewable energy is high it will only be affordable to the affluent.

### What are your top two/three environmental priorities?
1. Securing the solar access rights of all property owners.
2. Bringing edible plants to Eugene public spaces.
3. We need to do something to create a local solution to plastic recycling.

## What can we do in Eugene to _Lead Green_?

### Impact design
We market ourselves as the _Silicon Shire_ in contrast to the Silicon Valley. We have the capability here in Eugene to take environmental protection including renewable forms of energy seriously. I see opportunities in Eugene for solar power production, Solar panel manufacture, and solar panel recycling. City Council needs to set the policy to make the industries around these enterprises work.

Eugene's growing influence in the tech industry gives us a great opportunity to foster new business opportunities which can leverage our green ideals in places where that tech is used.

### Solar Access
Solar access is important to all Eugene citizens because solar access is an important component in Environmental health.

Eugene City has chosen to make Environmental health one of the components in the city's _[Triple Bottom Line](https://www.eugene-or.gov/512/Triple-Bottom-Line)_ analysis framework.

Alan Zelenka helped establish solar rights for Eugene property owners early in his career. However he let these rights become limited for property owners of smaller lots. This favors new construction, but is it the kind of construction we want and need in our city?

All property owners in Eugene need to be assured proper solar access. As our community seeks to lower carbon emissions, every home owner needs to be able to have the capability of doing so.

## Leading Eugene

_When it comes to reporting on progress towards reaching climate goals, should the city be reporting on its infrastructure performance, or the performance of all activities within the city limits?_

It is Hugh's position that the city holds a special place in our economy. We have the power to encourage and motivate businesses and residents to implement renewable energy solutions.  The city's metrics for success should be the measure of our entire community, not the number of electric cars the city operates. See: https://www.eugene-or.gov/3188/Climate-Action-Goals

It follows then that every house and business should be able to use the sun's power most productively. Property owners need to know that their rights to solar access are secure. These rights were brought in by Alan Zelanka early in his career, but then these protections were gutted in favor of generating new construction. They were gutted by limiting the protections to certain lot sizes. These solar protections need to be restored. Solar (PV and Water, and passive energy efficiency) need to be in our community sponsored solutions.

## Personal example

![Paterson Solar Arrays](https://hugh4.us/img/Paterson-solar.JPG "Paterson Solar Arrays")

Hugh has two 6.1 kWp systems (each has about 21 panels) in place on his roof. On a full day of sun in April they produce about 33-34 kWh of power. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) that is about the same as a gallon of unleaded gasoline. For Mr. Paterson the longterm investment was based on the longterm planning he and his wife did related to their expected energy consumption. For the past year they consumed a little over 10,000 kWh of Electric and so were able to off set that with one power system. Their power system is not designed to be an emergency power solution. It is grid connected. Mr. Paterson uses the grid for power storage. Hugh says:

>We use [EWEB's](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/going-green/solar-electric) net meter solution. This solution says that for each kWh of power we put on to the grid we get a credit back (for a kWh used on a later billing cycle) or we get financially compensated for the overage at the end of 12 months.  

>It is concerning that EWEB in some locations is considering moving to a [Smart Metering solution](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/smart-meters-and-smart-grid/opt-out-program). This may mean that our daytime power is not as valuable as our nighttime power. This should be a concern for all owners of PV solar systems.

## Solar residential

EWEB says that the [average household uses 1,600 kWh a month](http://www.eweb.org/business-customers/going-green/greenpower-for-business). For that [they pay](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/residential-pricing)  ¢ 5.948 X 800 and ¢ 7.435 x 800 for something like  $47.58 + $59.48 = $107.06 or just over $1,200 per year. Could we lower the cost of living in Eugene by $1,200 per year? Does that make housing in Eugene more affordable? Solar Power is sensible not only because it leads to a better environment, but because over the long term it is the cheaper option. Let's work to make it the affordable option for many more people in Eugene.

## Solar commercial

How can we empower small businesses to operate more efficiently by removing $500 per month in electrical utility costs? What does accountability for lowering consumption look like? If we are going to meet our community goals then we need to include _empowering_ business. Right now solar makes sense for business due to federal tax credits, but we can and have a responsibility to accelerate the cost savings and conversion to renewable power generation.
