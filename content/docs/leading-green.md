## How will you help leading Eugene toward 100% Clean Energy by 2050?
We need to work on community development strategies (especially at the city policy level) that make passive home construction practical and affordable. This needs to be part of our affordable housing plan. We also need create an economy where renewable energy solutions are the affordable solution. Right now there is a significant financial barrier, and a slow return on investment for those who pay upfront for renewable Energy. As long as the cost of renewable energy is high it will only be affordable to the affluent.

### What are your top two/three environmental priorities?
1. Securing the solar access rights of all property owners.
2. Bringing edible plants to Eugene public spaces.
3. We need to do something to create a local solution to plastic recycling.

## What can we do in Eugene to _Lead Green_?

We market ourselves as the _Silicon Shire_ in contrast to the Silicon Valley. We have the capability here in Eugene to take environmental protection including renewable forms of energy very seriously. I see opportunities in Eugene for solar power production, Solar panel manufacture, and solar panel recycling. City Council needs to set the policy to make the industries around these enterprises work.

Eugene's growing influence in the tech industry gives us a great opportunity to foster new business opportunities which can leverage our green ideals in places where that tech is used.

## Personal example

Hugh has two 6.1 kWp systems (each has about 21 panels) in place on his roof. On a full day of sun in April they produce about 33-34 kWh of power. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) that is about the same as a gallon of unleaded gasoline. For Mr. Paterson the longterm investment was based on the longterm planning he and his wife did related to their expected energy consumption. For the past year they consumed a little over 10,000 kWh of Electric and so were able to off set that with one power system. Their power system is not designed to be an emergency power solution. It is grid connected. Mr. Paterson uses the grid for power storage. Hugh says:

>We use [EWEB's](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/going-green/solar-electric) net meter solution. This solution says that for each kWh of power we put on to the grid we get a credit back (for a kWh used on a later billing cycle) or we get financially compensated for the overage at the end of 12 months.  

>It is concerning that EWEB in some locations is considering moving to a [Smart Metering solution](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/smart-meters-and-smart-grid/opt-out-program). This may mean that our Daytime power is not as valuable as our nighttime power. This should be a concern for all owners of PV solar systems.
