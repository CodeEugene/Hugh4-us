# Open Data in context

In the Eugene context of governance, citizens want to know that the city is acting fairly and in their best interests. One way to do this is to take the city's transactional and research data and put that in the public space.

For Eugene there are two important aspects of open data: comprehension and possess-ability.

## Comprehension

The web is a primary means of communication for many (most) of the people living in Eugene. The citizens need to be able to view the data and be able understand (within reason) the applicability of the data. For instance when looking at Budget data citizens need to be able to see revenues contrasted with expenses with a minimum granularity of the project component level. i.e. _What budget items did the railroad quite zone come from, how were those monies previously allocated, and what were the costs, and who was the recipient of the funds?_

This data should be understandable from the tax, sale, or bond revenue stream to the point of expensing.

## Possess - ability

To be fully in the public space the data needs to not just be _browse-able_ but also _download-able_ in formats that allow citizens to make their own charts and graphs with their own software. Citizens want to be able to verify the narrative developed by the city staff (often supported with claims of fact). Currently this narrative - as demonstrated through data - is not accessible by the city council or the citizens. Allowing individual access to transactional data and report based data allows citizens to compare costs with impacts. Citizens might be able to freely look at police response times, number of times the city is repairing vehicles, citing homeless people for trespassing or sleeping on public property, how much income is generated from assessing fees to internet providers, how many duplexes are actually built on corner lots, what the expected life span of a city road is under certain traffic conditions and the results from any traffic studies conducted, how many solar systems are in place in the city and where they are located, who has contracts with the city and how much they are worth.

## Open data brings greater transparency and allows for the citizens to engage at new levels with the ongoing goals of the city.

## Example

<img src="/img/City-data.JPG" alt="City Administration Housing data" />

In the above image the city presents some income data and contrasts that with housing cost data. What is not directly evident is

1. Where and how did the city get this data?
2. Where can citizens get this same data used to make the point in the presentation?
3. Why does the data not break down into the same categories that the city is using in other areas: where is the homeless population represented? If we have a strategy for addressing homelessness do they need to be also represented in this particular presentation?
4. In what areas of the city is housing really a challenge? Are there some areas where demand is higher than others?
