# Open Data in context

In the Eugene context of Governance Citizens want to know that the city is acting fairly and in their best interests. One way to do this is to take the city's transactional and research data and put that in the public space.

For Eugene there are two important aspects of open data: comprehension and possess-ability.

## Comprehension

The web is a primary means of communication for many (most) of the people living in Eugene. The citizens need to be able to view the data and be able understand (within reason) the applicability of the data. For instance when looking at Budget data citizens need to be able to see revenues contrasted with expenses with a minimum granularity of the project component level.

## Possess - ability

To be fully in the public space the data needs to not just be _browse-able_ but also _download-able_ in formats that allow citizens to make their own charts and graphs with their own software. The verification of narrative developed by the city staff (often supported with claims of fact) is more often than not in accessible by the city council or the citizens. Allowing individual access to transactional data and report based data allows citizens to compare costs with impacts. We might be able to freely look at police response times, number of times the city is repairing vehicles, citing homeless people for trespassing or sleeping on public property, or how much income is generated from assessing fees to internet providers.
