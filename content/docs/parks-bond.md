# Parks Benefits

No doubt that we need our parks. Hugh personally benefits from the recently redone Amazon playgraound.

# Parks Management

It is concerning to Hugh that we need a bond measure at all. Obviously, as a city, we have over extended our financial limitations. When we are running our own personal finances if we want a recreational fishing boat we can either save up for it, or take out a loan. If we take out the loan we most likely are living outside of our means. Hugh is hard pressed to understand how this is not the case for Eugene city parks.

If, as a city, we are living outside of our means then:

1. Why are we not living within our means?
2. Has our expected budget been cut, and why? - where else did the money go?
3. Why are these budgeted items/activities not supported under the normal budget? - it is a $667 million per year budget!

## Other management options

On both parks bonds Hugh voted **No!** He believes that the city should explore other management options.

>Rather than paying or increasing effective tax rates (through bonds), Hugh thinks it makes more sense to donate to a 501(c )3 foundation to support our parks. This sort of donation, has a much higher public involvement rate and  has the added financial benefit for the citizens, rather than a financial drain.

Some of Hugh's constituency has indicated that they have had conversations with Parks staff. These conversations have included suggestions for improved financial operations at parks facilities. These suggestions were not headed, and were, according to constituents, dismissed.

It may be that our park operations would benefit from a performance audit! Audit before bond!

## Dog license fees
It seems absurd to Hugh that Eugene has passed a dog license fee. Hugh' fails to see how the program to collect the fees is actually making more money than it costs to run. However, now that we have dog license fees we should do three things:

1. We should allocate 100% of the funds to methods the city uses to support dogs and their owners in their dog owning capacity i.e. the costs of managing and operating dog parks.
2. We should look at the more profitable cat licensing fee options - Cat owners are just as likely to pay a fee and the city is likely to have less costs in supporting cats.
3. We should look at licensing children.

**Note: The last to items are a farce, but it shows how absurd this license fee is!**

## Open and Green Space management

One of the critical components of healthy community is access to open and green spaces. In Eugene we think of these as *parks*. But they don't always need to be *city parks*, they could be private parks, or orchards, or rural areas inside the Urban Growth Boundary. Hugh would like to see more kinds of nature scapes within the city limits. Our current land use policies fail to protect the various possible kinds of open and green spaces within the UGB. Portland has something called rural reserves. These areas are within the city limits and are basically under contract for 50 years, to **not** be developed. These areas are set aside for agricultural purposes. The limiting of our UGB has accelerated the development of all kinds of land within the UGB, sometimes to the detriment of land's natural best uses. Our long term strategy for land use needs to include non-park green spaces.
