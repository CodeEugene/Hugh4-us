## What kind of auditor solution does Eugene need?

 Many citizens in Eugene feel that they cannot trust the Eugene City Government. This needs to change. An [independent (elected) auditor](https://electedauditor4cityaccountability.org/) is the best option presently presented for restoring trust between the governed and the governing.

 However, it is Hugh's position that an elected auditor alone will not generate the kinds of results needed or desired to restore trust. We need a re-positioning of government.

## Why is Solar access an important issue?

Solar access is important to all Eugene citizens because solar access is an important component in Environmental health.

Eugene City has chosen to make Environmental health one of the components in the city's _[Triple Bottom Line](https://www.eugene-or.gov/512/Triple-Bottom-Line)_ analysis framework.

Alan Zelenka helped establish solar rights for Eugene property owners early in his career. However he let these rights become limited for property owners of smaller lots. This favors new construction, but is it the kind of construction we want and need in our city?

All property owners in Eugene need to be assured proper solar access. As our community seeks to lower carbon emissions, every home owner needs to be able to have the capability of doing so.

## Is the cost of housing in Eugene a real issue?

Yes. The cost of housing in Eugene is a real issue.

There are several factors which are causing the cost of housing to increase in Eugene.

1. The city government applied fees to new construction and renovations causes the housing prices to go up.

2. There is a rising population in Eugene. People are moving to Eugene, and the current population is naturally growing. This puts high demand on current housing inventories.

3. There is a fundamental shift in the kinds of dwelling situations that people want now, and those which were imagined to be needed when our current dwelling situations were built.

4. The current city government's policies do not allow for efficient usage of existing housing supply.

5. Wages are not keeping pace with costs of maintaining a dwelling in Eugene.

These and other issues are causing our housing costs to increase, this puts significant financial strain on many people in our community.

## Should Eugene ban assault rifles?

It does not make legal sense to create city law which conflicts with state law. It also does not make sense to pass a law like this when Eugene is so close to municipalities which would not ban assault rifles. This issue is best addressed at the state level. Concerned citizens of Eugene should participate in the state wide discussion. - Keep in mind, it  _already_ illegal in Eugene to kill someone. It doesn't matter if they are killed with arsenic, wearing old lace, or with an assault rifle _it is illegal_.

## Should Eugene implement a Construction Exercise Tax (CET )?
In response to  _Jacob Fox and Terry McDonald_ who published a guest opinion in the [Register Guard on April 6th 2018](http://registerguard.com/rg/opinion/36620851-78/construction-excise-tax-could-help-build-affordable-housing.html.csp).
**It does not make sense to implement a CET in Eugene.**

When we look at how the math pencils out, it would be much better for Eugene Citizens to donate to 501( c)3 organizations like St. Vincent de Paul who are making a real difference in Lane County. By implementing a CET, Eugene would be permanently increasing the cost of unsubsidized land and housing. By increasing the price of land we are further separating the economic classes which already disproportionately dis-advantages those who on the lower end of the economic spectrum. These actions will solidify the need for “subsidized housing” in Eugene. Forcing people to give to solve a social issue doesn’t actually solve the issue - it solidifies the problem. I ask these directors if they had $58,000 a week to solve the homeless problem in Eugene, _would that really solve the problem?_

CET is paid when building or remolding a home. It is assessed during the permit process - a process some are already claiming is to expensive. The indirect result (higher general housing prices) will greatly out weigh the direct results (small enclaves of subsidized housing). It may take a few months for housing prices to increase, but home owners will be adding the CET amount to the new sell price at the time of home's next re-sale. With higher house prices, how can we ever reach affordable housing for everyone? How does the “long tail” of the impact of the CET help St. Vincent de Paul achieve its goal to
>help all individuals find a path out of poverty and into self-sufficiency?

The CET fails at this point. It makes the transition from assisted housing to self-sufficiency a larger leap.

Perhaps those who want the CET, also want to protect the “value” of their properties and push the homeless crises out of their neighborhoods. It is quite easy to see how raising the price of a neighborhood would put any hope of integrating into well established Eugene neighborhoods out of reach for individuals or families transitioning into self-sufficiency. I ask the fantastic Mr. Fox and Terry McDonald, _does this prejudice foster a social attitude which is conducive to solving the social injustice goals their organizations report to combat?_  

501( c)3 organizations committed to creating social change, must have multiple bottom line methods of assessing the actions and programs their organizations participate undertake. This is not too different from the reasons Eugene City also has a multiple bottom line method for evaluating its endeavors. It is fantastic that St. Vincent de Paul is a leader in Lane County in meeting the needs of the poor - especially the homeless. However, if solutions for meeting physical needs also do not solve the sociological divides in our community then the proposed solutions need to be abandoned or reworked. Giving the payee of the CET the ability to assuage their conscience that they did something good for their fellow citizen without ever engaging directly with the individual (or the humanitarian organization) actually serves to disassociate the parties from each other.

The CET does not make economic sense (rising housing costs), it does not make sociological sense (brining our community together as a solution to social injustice issues), it does not make financial sense (just give a tax deductible donation). It does make sense that an aggressive city government would be interested in implementing the CET. Only 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing… that is in some implementation models the city gets to keep 50% of the tax to use on other things!

According to transcripts of the both the Eugene Planning Committee and the City Council not all of the revenue generated from a CET is required to be spend on housing subsidies. Therefore Mr. Fox and Mr. McDonald are likely to see a lot less than the numbers their opinion piece cites.

> "... are some flexibilities within the legislation so for a residential CET 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing incentives if local jurisdiction also adopts an inclusionary ..."

The CET has been discussed for some time in the city government. See Eugene city materials here: https://www.eugene-or.gov/3712/Task-Team-1

## What kind of Solar PV system do you have?

I have two 6.1 kWp systems (each has about 21 panels) in place on my roof. On a full day of sun in April they produce about 33-34 kWh of power. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) that is about the same as a gallon of petrol. For us the longterm investment was based on our longterm planning related to energy consumption. For the past year we consumed a little over 10,000 kWh of Electric and so we were able to off set that with one power system. Our power system was not designed to be an emergency power solution and is grid connected. We use the grid for power storage. We use [EWEB's](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/going-green/solar-electric) net meter solution. This solution says that for each kWh of power we put on to the grid we get a credit back (for a kWh used on a later billing cycle) or we get financially compensated for the overage at the end of 12 months.  

It is concerning that EWEB in some locations is considering moving to a [Smart Metering solution](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/smart-meters-and-smart-grid/opt-out-program). This may mean that our Daytime power is not as valuable as our nighttime power. This should be a concern for all owners of PV solar systems.

## How should a City Councilor keep their constituency informed?

Hugh would expect to be available via face to face meetings - coffee or a beer!
His phone number and email address are available on this website under "About Hugh".
It is in Hugh's nature to be a blogger. This might be an appropriate method. Sometimes the citizens can be well informed from methods the city already utilizes to inform citizens. One method citizens can currently use to stay abreast of city issues is the email messages sent out from various city departments. It is also appropriate for city councilors visit (to report and hear concerns from citizens) various Ward 3 neighborhood meetings. However, city councilors and candidates are aware that Neighborhood associations have relatively low attendance (when compared with the whole neighborhood population) and are therefore not representative of all or even the majority opinions held by the citizens of a neighborhood.

**Do you have a better idea?** I know that Eugene Public Schools and some departments in the city use tools like Facebook and Nextdoor to information to citizens.

## When do you replace the city manager?

_**Context**: This question was asked at the SUNA debate, with overture to the City Hall situation, and the City Manager withholing from the City Council cost over runs related to the project._

1. There is already a process in place for evaluating the performance of the city manager.  It is unclear to Hugh that the current city council required the reporting of cost over runs, though it would have been professional to do so. Therefore it seems that the responsibility for the reporting of cost over runs (and all kinds of reporting) rests squarely with city council.

 Perhaps $7 million on a budget of $667 million is not that much and can be found in other areas of the budget. (Or perhaps $7 million is how much an independent elected auditor might be able to save the city tax payers, because the city manager knows where he can save $7 million.)

 This is also where open, public transactional data for budgeting and projected spending would have allowed these issues to come to light sooner — hence why we need open data from our city.

 2. There is some management philosophy precedent for limiting the time a manager has in a management position. This is practiced in the military, in some positions of government, and in some non-profit organizations like churches. One strength of this method is it allows the organization to assess the programs and policies in place independent of the people making them happen. One thing that organizations need to be aware of if they take this route is succession planning. Abrupt changes in management can lead to operating inefficiencies in senior leadership and confusion among staff at the operations level. Hugh has seen these impacts personally in NGOs and has observed impacts at the US Federal level.

 An independent elected auditor can help  in this situation by providing performance evaluation on the projects and programs operated by city staff.


## What is your plan for dealing with the increasing homeless population that surrounds [White Bird clinic](http://whitebirdclinic.org/) on 12th Ave?

>I live in Ferry alley. As the weather warms the transient problem increases and brings all the usual problems. The dumpsters are scattered. Urban camping is tolerated and goes unnoticed or ignored on private property. I have contacted numerous property owners. They do what they can and some are not even local unfortunately. The Eugene police department is already spread thin enough. How can my vote guarantee my family’s safety and a clean neighborhood? Will there ever be a day when I don’t have to worry about my 4 year old picking up a needle as I walk down the sidewalk?
— Concerned Citizen

There are several important issues represented in this question and comment.  Hugh would like to put forward several considerations/solutions.

1. As a parent of a 2 1/2 year-old Hugh shares the concern about injury and the spread of disease via discarded needles.
>In my family I address this by taking time with my daughter to teach her about these sorts of dangers. Last week she wanted to take her shoes off and go barefoot at the playground. I said **no**, and she wanted to know why so we had a discussion about dangers and hurting her feet — my main concern at the time was discarded needles, not dangers presented by park equipment.

Our kids need parental involvement to help then identify and address dangers they will encounter — throughout life.
2. As far as Hugh is aware there is only one needle exchange in Lane County. This is at the [HIV Alliance](http://hivalliance.org/category/prevention/prev-hr/prev-hr-nex/). There may be other drop-off locations (and there are certainly other places to get needles), but part of the challenge we are presented with is that many of the needle using population don't care. This should be our biggest clue in trying to meet their needs. We should be asking _What has led them to a place where they don't care, and how can we restore hope?_
3. Neighborhood safety and cleanliness must be a grassroots effort. A regulation based effort is expensive, resource intensive, and does not address the long term needs of Eugene's homeless population. Criminalizing homelessness through the enforcement of loitering and trespassing ordinances costs the taxpayer more, and only reinforces prejudices between segments of society. We need to check our own attitudes and biases if we feel that we can regulate and solve Eugene urban camping through city ordinances. Do our solutions primarily solve _our felt needs_ (please remove the nuisance from around my dwelling) or _their felt needs_ (where and how can I live)?

Loneliness is a common theme that many people who are in a homeless situation (and also people who struggle with substance abuse) struggle with. We should ask ourselves: _How does our response (in our neighborhood, or via social services, or at city council) build community for everyone involved?_

4. Goverment in the USA, including Eugene City government, can not prevent people from doing activities. They can only react to those activities. Do you want a city ordinance which makes it legal to _conspire to_ "scatter dumpsters", or "to make noise"? Is it worth the added tax dollars to put in place a _legal response system_ to look for people who might "conspire to make noise"? No. such a system doesn't make sense. Nor does is address the needs of all of the citizens of Eugene — including the homeless, or "urban campers".
