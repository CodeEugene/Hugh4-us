#_Should the city be reporting on its infrastructure performance, or the performance of all activities within the city limits?_
#It follows then that every house and business should be able to use the sun's power most productively. Property owners need to know that their rights to solar access are secure. Therefore component of our construction should be in our community design planning and our reporting.

## What kind of auditor solution does Eugene need?

 Many citizens in Eugene feel that they cannot trust the Eugene City Government. This needs to change. An [independent (elected) auditor](https://electedauditor4cityaccountability.org/) is the best option presently presented for restoring trust between the governed and the governing.

 However, it is Hugh's position that an elected auditor alone will not generate the kinds of results needed or desired to restore trust. We need a re-positioning of government.

## Why is Solar access an important issue?

Solar access is important to all Eugene citizens because solar access is an important component in Environmental health.

Eugene City has chosen to make Environmental health is one of the components in Eugene city's _[Triple Bottom Line](https://www.eugene-or.gov/512/Triple-Bottom-Line)_ analysis framework.

Property owners in Eugene need to be assured proper solar access. As our community seeks to lower carbon emissions, every home owner needs to be able to have the capability of doing so.

## Is the cost of housing in Eugene a real issue?

Yes. The cost of housing in Eugene is a real issue.

There are several factors which are causing the cost of housing to increase in Eugene.

1. The city government applied fees to new construction and renovations causes the housing prices to go up.

2. There is a rising population in Eugene. People are moving to Eugene, and the current population is naturally growing. This puts high demand on current housing inventories.

3. There is a fundamental shift in the kinds of dwelling situations that people want now, and those which were imagined to be needed when our current dwelling situations were built.

4. The current city government's policies do not allow for efficient usage of existing housing supply.

5. Wages are not keeping pace with costs of maintaining a dwelling in Eugene.

These and other issues are causing our housing costs to increase, this puts significant financial strain on many people in our community.

## Should Eugene ban assault rifles?

It does not make legal sense to create city law which conflicts with state law. This issue is best addressed at the state level. Concerned citizens of Eugene should participate in the state wide discussion.

## Should Eugene implement a Construction Exercise Tax (CET )?
In response to  _Jacob Fox and Terry McDonald_ who published a guest opinion in the [Register Guard on April 6th 2018](http://registerguard.com/rg/opinion/36620851-78/construction-excise-tax-could-help-build-affordable-housing.html.csp).
**It does not make sense to implement a CET in Eugene.**

When we look at how the math pencils out, it would be much better for Eugene Citizens to donate to 501( c)3 organizations like St. Vincent de Paul who are making a real difference in Lane County. By implementing a CET, Eugene would be permanently increasing the cost of unsubsidized land and housing. By increasing the price of land we are further separating the economic classes which already disproportionately dis-advantages those who on the lower end of the economic spectrum. These actions will solidify the need for “subsidized housing” in Eugene. Forcing people to give to solve a social issue doesn’t actually solve the issue - it solidifies the problem. I ask these directors if they had $58,000 a week to solve the homeless problem in Eugene, _would that really solve the problem?_

CET is paid when building or remolding a home. It is assessed during the permit process - a process some are already claiming is to expensive. The indirect result (higher general housing prices) will greatly out weigh the direct results (small enclaves of subsidized housing). It may take a few months for housing prices to increase, but home owners will be adding the CET amount to the new sell price at the time of home's next re-sale. With higher house prices, how can we ever reach affordable housing for everyone? How does the “long tail” of the impact of the CET help St. Vincent de Paul achieve its goal to
>help all individuals find a path out of poverty and into self-sufficiency?

The CET fails at this point. It makes the transition from assisted housing to self-sufficiency a larger leap.

Perhaps those who want the CET, also want to protect the “value” of their properties and push the homeless crises out of their neighborhoods. It is quite easy to see how raising the price of a neighborhood would put any hope of integrating into well established Eugene neighborhoods out of reach for individuals or families transitioning into self-sufficiency. I ask the fantastic Mr. Fox and Terry McDonald, _does this prejudice foster a social attitude which is conducive to solving the social injustice goals their organizations report to combat?_  

501( c)3 organizations committed to creating social change, must have multiple bottom line methods of assessing the actions and programs their organizations participate undertake. This is not too different from the reasons Eugene City also has a multiple bottom line method for evaluating its endeavors. It is fantastic that St. Vincent de Paul is a leader in Lane County in meeting the needs of the poor - especially the homeless. However, if solutions for meeting physical needs also do not solve the sociological divides in our community then the proposed solutions need to be abandoned or reworked. Giving the payee of the CET the ability to assuage their conscience that they did something good for their fellow citizen without ever engaging directly with the individual (or the humanitarian organization) actually serves to disassociate the parties from each other.

The CET does not make economic sense (rising housing costs), it does not make sociological sense (brining our community together as a solution to social injustice issues), it does not make financial sense (just give a tax deductible donation). It does make sense that an aggressive city government would be interested in implementing the CET. Only 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing… that is in some implementation models the city gets to keep 50% of the tax to use on other things!

According to transcripts of the both the Eugene Planning Committee and the City Council not all of the revenue generated from a CET is required to be spend on housing subsidies. Therefore Mr. Fox and Mr. McDonald are likely to see a lot less than the numbers their opinion piece cites.

> "... are some flexibilities within the legislation so for a residential CET 50% of the resources must be used for local affordable housing incentives if local jurisdiction also adopts an inclusionary ..."

The CET has been discussed for some time in the city government. See Eugene city materials here: https://www.eugene-or.gov/3712/Task-Team-1

#What kind of Solar PV system do you have?
I have two 6.1 kWp systems (each has about 21 panels) in place on my roof. On a full day of sun in April they produce about 33-34 kWh of power. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline_gallon_equivalent) that is about the same as a gallon of petrol. For us the longterm investment was based on our longterm planning related to energy consumption. For the past year we consumed a little over 10,000 kWh of Electric and so we were able to off set that with one power system. Our power system was not designed to be an emergency power solution and is grid connected. We use the grid for power storage. We use [EWEB's](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/going-green/solar-electric) net meter solution. This solution says that for each kWh of power we put on to the grid we get a credit back (for a kWh used on a later billing cycle) or we get financially compensated for the overage at the end of 12 months.  

It is concerning that EWEB in some locations is considering moving to a [Smart Metering solution](http://www.eweb.org/residential-customers/smart-meters-and-smart-grid/opt-out-program). This may mean that our Daytime power is not as valuable as our nighttime power. This should be a concern for all owners of PV solar systems.
