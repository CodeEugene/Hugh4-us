## What kind of auditor solution does Eugene need?

 Many citizens in Eugene feel that they cannot trust the Eugene City Government. This needs to change. An [independent (elected) auditor](https://electedauditor4cityaccountability.org/) is the best option presently presented for restoring trust between the governed and the governing.

 However, it is Hugh's position that an elected auditor alone will not generate the kinds of results needed or desired to restore trust. We need a re-positioning of government.

## Why is Solar access an important issue?

Solar access is important to all Eugene citizens because solar access is an important component in Environmental health.

Eugene City has chosen to make Environmental health is one of the components in Eugene city's _[Triple Bottom Line](https://www.eugene-or.gov/512/Triple-Bottom-Line)_ analysis framework.

Property owners in Eugene need to be assured proper solar access. As our community seeks to lower carbon emissions, every home owner needs to be able to have the capability of doing so.

## Is the cost of housing in Eugene a real issue?

Yes. The cost of housing in Eugene is a real issue.

There are several factors which are causing the cost of housing to increase in Eugene.

1. The city government applied fees to new construction and renovations causes the housing prices to go up.

2. There is a rising population in Eugene. People are moving to Eugene, and the current population is naturally growing. This puts high demand on current housing inventories.

3. There is a fundamental shift in the kinds of dwelling situations that people want now, and those which were imagined to be needed when our current dwelling situations were built.

4. The current city government's policies do not allow for efficient usage of existing housing supply.

5. Wages are not keeping pace with costs of maintaining a dwelling in Eugene.

These and other issues are causing our housing costs to increase, this puts significant financial strain on many people in our community.

## Should Eugene ban assault rifles?

It does not make legal sense to create city law which conflicts with state law. This issue is best addressed at the state level. Concerned citizens of Eugene should participate in the state wide discussion.
